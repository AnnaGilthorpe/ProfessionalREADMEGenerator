# Professional README Generator


## Project Description
The aim of this challenge was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input.

The app ensures that:-

<li>When a user enters the project title, it's displayed as the title of the README</li>

<li>When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.</li>

<li>When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.</li>

<li>When a user enters their GitHub username, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile.</li>

<li>When a user enters their email address, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.</li>

<li>When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.</li>

It requests the information from the user via a series of prompts.
